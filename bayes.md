# Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule is a formula used to find conditional probability.

## Bayes' Formula

P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)

## Simple Explanation

- P(A|B): probability of A given B  
- P(B|A): probability of B given A  
- P(A): probability of A  
- P(B): probability of B  

## Example

If:
- P(A) = 0.3  
- P(B|A) = 0.5  
- P(B) = 0.4  

Then:

P(A|B) = (0.5 × 0.3) / 0.4 = 0.375

## Conclusion

Bayes' Rule helps us update probability when we get new information.
